## TrumpDieEuro
This android-based game was created a few years ago while I was working in Europe. It was my first venture into using Unity, a cross-platform game engine, where I incorporated augmented reality components from a blog I stumbled upon.

Regrettably, I lost my laptop containing the original code, leaving me with only the APK file. However, I've decided to share the download link here for those interested.

I can recreate the code upon request; it originally took me about four hours on a rainy Saturday.

## The tongue-in-cheek game depicting Trump stomping on the Euro
This was during a period when Euros were weak against Dollars.
