## TrumpDieEuro
This android-based game was created a few years ago while I was working in Europe. It was my first venture into using Unity, a cross-platform game engine, where I incorporated augmented reality components from a blog I stumbled upon.

Regrettably, I lost my laptop containing the original code, leaving me with only the APK file. However, I've decided to share the download link here for those interested.

I can recreate the code upon request; it originally took me about four hours on a rainy Saturday.

The tongue-in-cheek game depicting Trump stomping on the Euro. Of course, this was during a period when Euros were weak against Dollars.

## How to Have a Little Fun
1. Download the Android game [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ygk929tzVR9iAE7U0VkcOKCkOS6pF8Ra/view?usp=drive_link).
2. Enable app installs from Unknown Sources on Android:
Go to Settings > Security.
Check the option for Unknown sources.
Tap OK on the prompt message.
Select Trust.
3. Grab a 5 Euro bill and point your phone camera at it to see Trump appear (adjust the closeness to the bill as needed).
4. Don't have a Euro bill? No problem! You can use the digital version I shared above; it works just the same.
